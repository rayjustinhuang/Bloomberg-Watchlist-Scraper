# Bloomberg Watchlist Scraper
A script I made to scrape data from my Bloomberg Watchlist and save it as a CSV file. I did this to understand how much my hidden costs (mutual fund fees, etc.) were for each of the funds I had invested in.

## Rationale
The only way I currently track some of my major investments is via Bloomberg's Watchlist feature. However, the shares and prices I input are already net of the fees that are charged to me by my bank.

I wanted to have a copy of the data that I could easily process and play with to calculate the fees that my bank was charging me. With this script, I was able to save the data to a CSV file and manipulate it later in Excel.
